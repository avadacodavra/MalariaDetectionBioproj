# MalariaDetectionBioproj
<br>
Malaria, a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, poses a significant global health threat, particularly in regions with limited access to healthcare services. Early detection of malaria-infected cells, particularly red blood cells (RBCs), is crucial for timely treatment and preventing severe complications. This project presents a hybrid model for malaria cell detection, combining feature extraction using a pre-trained VGG19 model with classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the model aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of malaria diagnosis.
